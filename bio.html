	<p>I'm a 21-year-old college senior without a clue of what I want to do with my life. I decided to take COMP 20 to learn a marketable, applicable skill that I was also quite curious about. I had spent my life on the web, but I knew very little about its inner workings; imagine playing an instrument for your entire life without knowing how to read music, or speaking a language without knowing how to write it. It's only natural to want to understand how it all works.</p>
	<p>My prior coding experience includes COMP 11, COMP 15, and two summers of data analysis in MATLAB. I have no prior HTML, CSS, or JavaScript experience.</p>
