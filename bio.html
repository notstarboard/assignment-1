	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm a college senior from Hingham, MA without a clue of what I want to do with my life. I decided to take COMP 20 both to learn a marketable, relevant skill, and to satisfy my curiosity about the web. I had spent my life on the web, but I knew very little about its inner workings; imagine playing an instrument for your entire life without knowing how to read music, or speaking a language without knowing how to write it. It's only natural to want to understand how it all works.</p>
	<p>My prior coding experience includes COMP 11, COMP 15, and two summers of data analysis in MATLAB. I have no prior HTML, CSS, or JavaScript experience.</p>
