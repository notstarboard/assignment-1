This website contains three pages: index, bio, and resume. The index page redirects visitors to my github.io website, shows some information, and contains links to both the bio and resume pages. The bio offers some information about me, while the resume is more or less my current resume with the contact information removed.

This assignment was done alone, although I did discuss it with Johnny Lau, Vincent Tran, and Michele Mei.

It took approximately 8 hours to make.
